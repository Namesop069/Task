                <p><strong>Rem Koolhaas</strong> and <strong>Joshua Prince-Ramus</strong> of the Dutch firm <em>Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA)</em>, working in conjunction with the Seattle firm <strong>LMN Architects</strong>, served as the building's principal architects. <strong>Ramus</strong> served as the partner in charge. <strong>Bjarke Ingels</strong> designed the interior boxes for <em>OMA</em>.</p><p><em>OMA</em> was not one of the firms invited to compete for the project. <strong>Ramus</strong>, formerly a Seattle resident, found out from his mother one day in advance that the library board was inviting interested firms to attend a mandatory public meeting. He flew in, and <strong>OMA</strong> ended up winning the project.</p><p><strong>Deborah Jacobs</strong>, Chief Librarian in the Seattle Public Library system, spearheaded the project from the library's perspective and served as the primary client voice, while <strong>Betty Jane Narver</strong> served as president of the <strong>Library Board</strong>.</p><p>The architects conceived the new <strong>Central Library</strong> building as a <em>celebration of books</em>, deciding after some research that despite the arrival of the 21st century and the <em>"digital age"</em>, people still respond to books printed on paper. The 11-story <strong>Central Library</strong> has a capacity for over <strong>1.5 million books</strong>, in comparison to only <strong>900,000</strong> in the old library building.</p><p>The architects also worked to make the library <em>inviting to the public</em>, rather than stuffy, which they discovered was the popular perception of libraries as a whole.</p><p>Although the library is an unusual shape from the outside, the architects' philosophy was to <em>let the building's required functions dictate what it should look like</em>, rather than imposing a structure and making the functions conform to that.</p>

                <p><strong>The first level</strong>, facing <em>4th Avenue</em>, has a <em>lobby</em>, <em>holds pick-up</em>, and a <em>children's center</em>. It also includes the <strong>Microsoft Auditorium</strong>, which seats 275 people for events.</p><p>An <em>escalator</em> connects the <em>4th Avenue lobby</em> to the <strong>third level</strong>, which faces <em>5th Avenue</em> and is named the <strong>Norcliffe Foundation Living Room</strong>. It includes a <em>small cafe</em>, a <em>gift shop</em>, and a <em>teen center</em>.</p><p>The <strong>fourth level</strong>, named the <strong>"Red Floor"</strong>, uses 13 shades of red paint on surfaces and includes <em>four meeting rooms</em> and <em>two computer labs</em>.</p><p>The <strong>main computer lab</strong> is located on the <strong>fifth level</strong>, named the <strong>Charles Simonyi Mixing Chamber</strong>, with <strong>338 computer stations</strong> and a <em>reference desk</em>.</p><p>A major section of the building is the <strong>"Books Spiral"</strong>, which is designed to display the library's <em>nonfiction collection</em> without breaking up the <strong>Dewey Decimal System</strong>. The collection occupies the <strong>sixth</strong>, <strong>seventh</strong>, <strong>eighth</strong>, and <strong>ninth stories</strong> on a continuous slope of <strong>2 degrees</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>eighth level</strong> includes <em>music practice rooms</em>, while the <strong>ninth level</strong> has a <em>genealogy collection</em> and a <em>map room</em>.</p><p>The <strong>tenth level</strong> is divided between the <strong>Seattle Room</strong>, containing <em>local history collections</em>, and the <strong>Betty Jane Narver Reading Room</strong> with <strong>400 seats</strong>. It also includes the <em>highest viewpoints</em> in the building.</p><p><strong>New functions</strong> include <em>automatic book sorting</em>, <em>self-checkout</em>, <em>wireless communication</em> for staff, and over <strong>400 public computer terminals</strong>.</p><p>Below the library is a <strong>143-stall parking garage</strong> open to patrons and the public for a fee.</p>

                <p><strong>Use of the building</strong> is more than <em>double the predicted volume</em>. In the library's first year, <strong>2.3 million people</strong> came to visit; roughly <strong>30%</strong> were from <em>outside Seattle</em>. The library generated <strong>$16 million</strong> in new <em>economic activity</em> for its surrounding area in its first year.</p><p>The opinion of <em>architectural critics</em> and the <em>general public</em> has been <strong>mixed</strong>. Paul Goldberger, writing in <em>The New Yorker</em>, declared the Seattle Central Library <strong>"the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating."</strong></p><p>The <strong>American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)</strong> of Washington awarded the Library its <strong>Platinum Award</strong> for <em>innovation</em> and <em>engineering</em> in its "structural solutions". The library also received a <strong>2005 national AIA Honor Award for Architecture</strong>.</p><p><strong>Lawrence Cheek</strong>, architecture critic for the <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em>, revisited the building in 2007 and found it <strong>"confusing, impersonal, uncomfortable, oppressive"</strong> on the whole, with various features <em>"decidedly unpleasant," "relentlessly monotonous," "badly designed and cheesily detailed," "profoundly dreary and depressing,"</em> and <em>"cheaply finished or dysfunctional"</em>. He concluded that his earlier praise for the building was a <strong>"mistake."</strong></p><p>The library was roundly <strong>condemned</strong> by the <em>Project for Public Spaces</em>, which noted: <strong>"if the library were a true 'community hub,' its most active areas would connect directly to the street, spinning off activity in every direction."</strong> It went on to say the library <strong>"fails completely"</strong> in that aspect. The group criticized critics for being <em>"blinded by the architect's knack for flash and publicity,"</em> stating they <em>"cannot locate, or perhaps refuse to acknowledge, the faults in his creation."</em></p><p>The library’s <strong>confusing layout</strong> was also explored in the book <em>Take One Building: Interdisciplinary Research Perspectives of the Seattle Central Library</em> by architect <strong>Ruth Conroy Dalton</strong> and cognitive scientist <strong>Christoph Hölscher</strong>. Researchers used the library as a <strong>model case</strong> for studying the <em>interplay between building complexity</em> and <em>individual differences in wayfinding ability</em>.</p>
